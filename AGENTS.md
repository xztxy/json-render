Instructions for AI coding agents working with this codebase.

## Package Management

**Always check the latest version before installing a package.**

Before adding or updating any dependency, verify the current latest version on npm:

```bash
npm view <package-name> version
```

Or check multiple packages at once:

```bash
npm view ai version
npm view @ai-sdk/provider-utils version
npm view zod version
```

This ensures we don't install outdated versions that may have incompatible types or missing features.

## Code Style

- Do not use emojis in code or UI
- Do not use barrel files (index.ts that re-exports from other files)
- Use shadcn CLI to add shadcn/ui components: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`

## Workflow

- Run `pnpm type-check` after each turn to ensure type safety

## Source Code Reference

Source code for dependencies is available in `opensrc/` for deeper understanding of implementation details.

See `opensrc/sources.json` for the list of available packages and their versions.

Use this source code when you need to understand how a package works internally, not just its types/interface.

### Fetching Additional Source Code

To fetch source code for a package or repository you need to understand, run:

```bash
npx opensrc <package>           # npm package (e.g., npx opensrc zod)
npx opensrc pypi:<package>      # Python package (e.g., npx opensrc pypi:requests)
npx opensrc crates:<package>    # Rust crate (e.g., npx opensrc crates:serde)
npx opensrc <owner>/<repo>      # GitHub repo (e.g., npx opensrc vercel/ai)
```

<!-- opensrc:end -->
