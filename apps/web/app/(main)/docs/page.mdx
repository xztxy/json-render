# Introduction

Predictable. Guardrailed. Fast. Let users generate dashboards, widgets, apps, and data visualizations from prompts.

## What is json-render?

json-render lets end users generate UI from natural language prompts — safely constrained to components you define. You set the guardrails: what components exist, what props they take, what actions are available. AI generates JSON that matches your schema, and your components render it natively.

## Why json-render?

### Guardrailed

AI can only use components in your catalog. No arbitrary code generation.

### Predictable

JSON output matches your schema, every time. Actions are declared by name, you control what they do.

### Fast

Stream and render progressively as the model responds. No waiting for completion.

## How it works

1. Define the guardrails — what components, actions, and data bindings AI can use
2. Users prompt — end users describe what they want in natural language
3. AI generates JSON — output is always predictable, constrained to your catalog
4. Render fast — stream and render progressively as the model responds
